This project is about the analysis of different audio files in order to compute the ”speaker recognition
task”, that is about reading the file and select who’s speaking from a set of possible choices. For
the analysis, I have used Librosa n.d., that is a Python package for music and audio analysis. It
provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems.
